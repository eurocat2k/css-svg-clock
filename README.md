The following tutorial helps to recreate the HH:MM:SS clock below, which then can be used on your next project page.

The basic idea come from [Online Tutorials](https://youtu.be/eoSfzVz9ur0) youtube page. I redesigned and added some extra features to the original work. Enjoy, and feel free to comment!

I'll try to follow the development - as it was happened at my desk - step by step, phase by phase with lot of comments, pictures, and code snippets. Some times I will give you some hints to be able to readjust or add more features to the design.
